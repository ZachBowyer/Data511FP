The worldwide meat consumption dataset, respectively named "meat_consumption_worldwide.csv" consists of 5 columns and 13761 rows (133KB). The columns are 'Location', 'subject', 'MEASURE', 'time', and 'Value.

For the first column, 'Location' is a categorical description of which specific country out of 48 is being looked at.
The second column, 'subject' is another categorical column that determines what type of meat is being considered (Beef, Pig, Poultry, Sheep).
Next, the 'Measure' column is a categorical column that describes the units of the 'Value' column (Kilograms per person annually or thousands of tons per region annually)
The fourth column, 'time' is a categorical column that shows the year the data was recorded (1991-2026- which means there are some projections).
Finally, the 'Value', column which is a regressive column, shows the meat consumption for that country, time, meat type, etc (0-131607.31).
We intend to use this dataset to help identify how specific countries/regions have consumed meat products over time. It will likely be used in a colormap plot of the world's geography, where a continuous color scale of 'carbon footprint' will be used, which can be calculated from both food-related carbon facts and consumption rate data. Additionally, we can use this dataset to help tell the story of the '3rd world burden', which essentially shows that while 3rd world countries may have higher emissions, they consume less.
